### Hi, I'm Sam, a computational biologist and data scientist

I'm currently working at the [Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult](https://ct.catapult.org.uk/) as a [Data Scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thompson-sed/).

#### Background

My PhD was in computational ecology, working on building [packages for simulating neutral models of biodiversity](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13451) at Imperial College London and the National University of Singapore. I am still passionate about ecology.

I now work as a data scientist, with my current role involving application development ([Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)), data engineering, bioinformatics (including scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, RIBO-seq and SSV-seq) and machine learning.
